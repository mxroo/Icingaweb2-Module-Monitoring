# Icingaweb2 Module Monitoring


Icinga2 script for monitoring the version of Icingaweb2 Modules

This script requires the user that Icinga2 runs checks as to be a member of the icingaweb2 group.

Provide the name of the module as the single variable to this script, and it will compare the version in github to the version reported by icingacli.
